# Q-HIU

Quantitative Hyperspectral Image Unmixing (Q-HIU) method retrieves biochemical constituents (components) from Raman micro-spectroscopy data as described in the paper "E. G. Lobanova and S. V. Lobanov, arXiv:1803.01823 (2018)" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01823).

The main function is Q_HIU.m. It consists of three main steps: Singular Value Decomposition with Automatic Divisive Correlation (SVD_ADC.p), Bottom Gaussian Fitting (BGF.p), and Quantitative Unsupervised/Partially Supervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization (Q_USPS_NMF.p).
